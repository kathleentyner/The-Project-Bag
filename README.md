Knitters (and other crafters) often hoard materials, have multiple projects going at one time, and need an easy to access resource library that contains materials most relevant to their projects. 

The Project Bag helps knitters stay organized and inspired for their next project by inventorying materials, projects and resources. 

Users are able to use tags to making searching projects and yarn easy. For in stance a user could search the DK tag (a yarn weight) and see all yarn inventory and projects with the DK tag. 

Users are able to keep track of their projects by sorting them by in progress, completed, and queued. No more abandoned sweaters that just need one more sleeve. 

Finally, users have a custom resource library where they can store links to helpful articles and tutorial videos, find that one really great W/T tutorial you saw 6 months ago without searching YouTube. Knitters can also add items to their wishlist, maybe it’s an expensive yarn or pattern, or maybe some stitchmarks you saw on etsy. It’s all stored in one place.
